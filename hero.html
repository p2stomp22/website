<h1> My Hero </h1>

<p> The hero I chose for this project is Max Verstappen. Max Verstappen is a famous Formula 1 driver from the Netherlands. As the son of a former F1 driver, he started driving at a very young age. Verstappen first started driving F1 when he was only 17 years old, and with that, he was the youngest driver in the history of F1. He drives for Red Bull Racing and is currently second in the F1 standings. </p>

<p> The reason I chose Max Verstappen as my hero is because I think his accomplishments are incredible. I clearly remember watching his very first race with my family, and how we, much like the rest of the world, were incredibly surprised and impressed when he won first place. I still lived in the Netherlands at that time, and our town and the towns around us were especially proud that day because he actually grew up in the town next to us. I think that he is just an awesome example that with hard work and dedication anything is possible! </p>
