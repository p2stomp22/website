		<td style="width:30%"><font color="64502E" face="Century Gothic" size="4">Paris gets its name from the Parissi people who settled on a small island in the Seine river over two thousand years ago. After being captured by the Romans in fifty-two BCE, the town expanded onto the banks of the river. The city continued to grow and eventually became the capital of France nearly one millennium later. The city had seen much adversity from the plague which wiped out much of its citizens in the fourteenth century to the great violence that came with the French revolution in the eighteenth century. During World War II, the city fell under Nazi occupation, and in the more recent past, Paris has experienced an increase in violence in addition to several terrorist attacks. None of these events, however, had long-term success in destroying the beautiful and resilient city (“Paris”).</td>
