After being captured by the Romans in fifty-two BCE, the town expanded onto the banks of the river. The city continued to grow and eventually became the capital of France nearly one millennium later. The city had seen much adversity from the plague which wiped out much of its citizens in the fourteenth century to the great violence that came with the French revolution in the eighteenth century. During World War II, the city fell under Nazi occupation, and in the more recent past, Paris has experienced an increase in violence in addition to several terrorist attacks. None of these events, however, had long-term success in destroying the beautiful and resilient city (“Paris”).</td>

Since the tower was constructed in the nineteenth century for the International Exposition of 1889, the tower has been a symbol of technological and industrial brilliance (“Eiffel Tower”). Every night the tower sparkles for 5 minutes every hour on the hour, which would be the perfect time to get the perfect Parisian picture. One is able to access the tower from nine-thirty in the morning until midnight daily either by walking the endless stairs or simply talking the elevators. Ticket prices vary based on the mode of transportation up the tower and how far up the tower one goes ranging from twenty-six for adults and thirteen euros for youth to the top by elevator to ten euros for adults and five euros for youth to the second floor by stairs (“Prices and Times”). Given that the tower is such an iconic spot, it is typically extremely crowded, which can make visiting the top of the tower a rather lengthy experience. For those only stopping by the beautiful city for a couple of days, it is not recommended to go onto the tower, instead, walk by the tower to get a quick picture and see it up close. Perhaps you could have visi  Place du Trocadero for an amazing view, or take a very popular boat tour on the Seine which will also provide you with many opportunities to get that perfect shot.

The believed-to-be-accidental blast was not the first time the famous landmark dating back to the early thirteenth century experienced severe damage. Over the course of its long and rich history, the Cathedral has undergone many renovations the most recent one starting in 2017 (Murphy and Zraick). After the fire, however, new, rather controversial, plans were forced to be drawn and the Cathedral is expected to remain in restoration until at least 2024 (Matthews). Although you cannot take tours of the Cathedral at this time, you are still able to stroll by and take in the magnificent gothic architecture with its two towers, flying buttresses, rose windows, and carvings of biblical figures.

The former power seat of France is surrounded by beautiful gardens filled with sculptures and fountains, which flow into the park of Versailles, a “haven of greenery” open to the public free of charge. A short walk from the main palace lies the estate of Trianon. This addition to the estate of Versailles is essentially a collection of private retreats belonging to the former inhabitants of the palace--an escape from “courtly etiquette” (“the Estate”). </br></br>
		Even the prince’s precious white horse has an extraordinary place to call home at Versailles. The Royal Stables once housed over two thousand horses requiring a total of fifteen hundred workers and are still used today for a variety of purposes. One is able to visit one of the many shows or simply walk through and explore the coach collection when taking a tour (“The Royal Stables”). To visit the estate of Versailles one needs to book a time slot in advance. Admission to the estate and Trianon is free for everyone under the age of eighteen and twenty-six for EU residents. Other tickets including special tours, boat rides, horse shows, etc. vary in price. Make sure you explore what may be the right fit for you on the website before booking (“Tickets and Prices”). Its grandness and luxury, as well as its rich history, and immense collection make the estate of Versailles a truly extraordinary place to visit.

The handles of paper shopping bags filled with clothing dig into the palm of one hand, while the other holds a Nutella crepe carefully trying not to spill the delicious strawberries onto the stones of the Champs Elysees. If one is to go shopping in Paris--a must according to many-the Champs-Élysées is the spot to go to. There is a reason the street is always bustling; it is home to countless stores ranging from larger chains like Zara and Gap to upscale boutiques and exclusive designers. When you need a little break from all the shopping stimuli, you can sit back and enjoy a nice meal in one of the many restaurants and eateries on or near the street.</br></br>
		Depending on the direction of your adventure, you will eventually either reach Place de la Concorde--the main square in Paris and the location of countless deaths by guillotine such as Queen Marie-Antoinette and the famous Robespierre (Lewis)-- n the east end of the street, or you will end up at the Arc de Triomphe at the west end. The commemorative monument is an iconic symbol for the French, as it was built in the early 19th century by Napoleon to “celebrate the military achievements of the French armies” (Murray), so when strolling through the beautiful avenue, make sure to you do not forget to stop by and observe the massive arch.

The shopping center divided into three sections--le Coupole, l’Homme, and Lafayette Maison and Gourmet--provides such a unique experience it has become a tourist attraction on its own. The main part--le Coupole--contains eight stories housing over two-thousand brands and several restaurants, cafes, and bars. But that’s not all, Galerie Lafayettes contains a mesmerizing 141-foot dome, a rooftop with breathtaking views, and it even hosts a fashion show every Friday afternoon. Other parts of the shopping center include the Lafayette Maison and Gourmet building selling not only home and cooking supplies but also offering cooking classes and macaron workshops. Galerie Lafayettes is truly more than just a department store; it is an experience that could take all afternoon, a whole day even for the true fashionistas. It is highly recommended to stop by if you are looking to upgrade your wardrobe or pass some time when staying in the fashion capital for more than a few days (Lyons).

In the early evening, friends, families, and lovers sit on the stairs leading up to the Basilica waiting for the sky to turn endless shades of dandelion yellow, marigold orange, and rose red; if you wait long enough for the sky to turn dark and the stars to start shining, you can enjoy the view of the city of lights with the Eiffel Tower sparkling in the distance. Besides its panoramic views, the basilica is also known for its beauty and sacred religious location. The chalky white castle-like Sacré-Cœur has an extraordinary design and is open to the public. Although it is tempting to take a picture of the beautiful interior with its colorful mosaic ceiling--the largest one in France--there is no photography allowed inside. Instead, really take in the design while you are there and perhaps listen to the free audio guide along the way--you can download it onto your phone ahead of time (Liebling-Goldberg).

The fairly new airport is the largest international airport in France and the second largest in Europe. If you are flying into or out of Paris internationally, you will most likely be landing here. Another one of Paris’s airports is Orly Airport; it is the second-largest international airport in France and is more frequently used for European flights. Although it is not as large and well-connected as Charles de Gaulle Airport, Orly Airport is on average less expensive both on flight prices and hotel stays nearby. In addition to this, it is closer to the city center which can help you save on transportation rates to or from the city (Mona).

What started out as a small and quaint station in the mid-nineteenth century, has grown to welcome over 700,000 passengers daily making it the busiest train station in Europe! As if this wasn’t grand enough already, the Gare du Norde is currently in the process of tripling its size ahead of the 2024 Olympics, which will be hosted in the city. The chic and classical architecture will be met with a highly modern design creating an airport-like flow and incorporating dozens of shops and boutiques. </br></br>
		Amiens, Lille, Brussels, Amsterdam, Cologne, and Essen--Gare du Nord has excellent connections to numerous large cities all over the continent. Even London is one of the possible destinations for travelers; Eurostar offers a high-speed train that will allow you to travel through the Channel Tunnel and arrive in the capital of England in a matter of only a few hours! Gare du Nord is well-connected to the rest of Paris as well; this is through Paris Metro and RER urban trains. Although the train station is completely safe during the day, it is recommended to steer clear of it at night. If possible, arrive in or depart from the city while the sun is still shining (“Gare du Nord Paris – Guide To The Busiest Train Station In Europe”).
