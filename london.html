Over the many years of its existence, the capital of England has had numerous names--including  Lundenwic and Lundenburh--as well as many different settlers and rulers. Each left a mark on the city shaping it into the influential cosmopolitan city it is today. The metropolis has seen it all; times of extreme prosperity and times of utter catastrophe. The city has faced challenges from the plague to the deadly pollution following the industrial revolution. Its resilience enabled it to recover from the Great Fire destroying thousands of builidngs and the many militaries as well as terrorist attacks it has faced as it now thrives as one of the most influential financial centers in the world (“London”).</td>

		<td style="width:30%"><font color="1A5053" face="Century Gothic" size="4"> Buckingham Palace, Palace of Westminster, Big Ben--these must-see landmarks make for a perfect afternoon of exploring British history. The most famous of the three, Buckingham Palace has been the official London residence of the British Royal Family for over two centuries. It is currently still used as the administrative headquarters for Queen Elizabeth II and hosts many official events and ceremonies (“Royal Residences: Buckingham Palace”). For a ten-week period in the summer as well as select dates in the winter, the staterooms in the palace are open to the public. In the summer of 2022, a special exhibit is included in the tour. According to the Royal Collection Trust, Platinum Jubilee: The Queen’s Accession is “a special display featuring the first official portraits of the young Queen and items of personal jewellery” (“Visit Buckingham Palace”). Tickets vary in price ranging from thirty pounds for adults, nineteen fifty for young adults, and sixteen fifty for children. It is important to note that it is possible to gain free re-admission for a year! In order to do this, you can request a Warden to stamp your ticket at the end of your visit; your ticket will be treated as a donation and converted into a one-year pass (“Visit Buckingham Palace”).</br></br>
		After a lovely morning exploring the throne room, ballroom, and drawing room of Buckingham Palace, The Palace of Westminster is only a mile away. One can walk to the Houses of Parliament while stopping by other famous landmarks in London, but taking the underground or riding a classic hop-on-hop-off bus is also a possibility. The iconic Gothic architecture of the palace is extraordinary and attracts many visitors; popular sights include the Big Ben tower, St Stephen's Chapel, and Westminster Hall. Because the former royal residence has fallen target to several tragedies over the years including devastating fires and German air raids during World War II, it has been rebuilt and repaired several times. </br></br>
		Since the sixteenth century, The Palace of Westminster has served as “the seat of the bicameral Parliament, including the House of Commons and the House of Lords” (“Houses of Parliament”). Tours of the inside of parliament are free but exclusively offered to UK residents. Non-UK resident visitors are not to worry; there are guided and mixed media tours of the Palace of Westminster available to all. Tickets vary in price but hover in the low twenties, with the guided tours costing slightly more (“Tours”). For those not interested in touring the palace, the Westminster neighborhood is still worth a visit as it is home to many more tourist attractions such as the St Margaret's Church, Westminster Abbey, the Churchill War Rooms, and much more!

The town of Camden is famous for its shopping, food, and its unique markets! The items found at the markets cannot be found anywhere else; they are quirky, artsy, and often one of a kind. Even the store buildings and streets are full of color and art! Most shops and stalls open up at ten in the morning and are open until “late” (“Visit Us”). Camden is truly one of the most fun spots to go shopping, have an amazing meal, and take original--definitely instagrammable--photos.

For anyone looking to spend a little money or do some window shopping, Oxford Street is the place to go. As Europe's busiest shopping street, the three-hundred store street welcomes over two hundred million people per year. At one end lies Tottenham Court Road station, while the other is home to the iconic Marble Arch. Along the street there are several opportunities to have some drinks or a fancy meal, there are even several hotels on and near Oxford Street (“Oxford Street Hotels, History & Shopping Guide”). </br></br> Quick tip: Saturdays tend to be the busiest days, while Sundays are the quietest.

Hyde park--spanning approximately three hundred and thirty acres--is like any other park a perfect spot to stop by and relax, stroll along the paths, and maybe a bike or run for some exercise. Besides its flora and fauna, however, the park has a lot more to offer to the public. One can rent a boat and spent time on Serpentine Lake in the summer or go ice-skating during the winter. For the athletically-inclined--or amateur wannabes--there are tennis courts, soccer goals, and a horse-riding arena. Among popular spots to stop by in Hyde Park is Speakers Corners; a “centre of free speech for soapbox orators” (“Hyde Park”), that has been used to express ideas and beliefs since the nineteenth century. Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain, and The Hudson Memorial Bird Sanctuary are just two of the many remarkable memorials Hyde Park is home to. </br></br>
		Visiting Hyde Park can be a lengthy experience if one chooses it to be; some people may spend an entire afternoon here. For those looking for a shorter get-away from the busyness of the city; Kensington Gardens may be a better fit. Most visitors don’t spend more than an hour exploring Kensington Gardens. Formerly a part of Hyde Park, Kensington Gardens is known to be more tranquil and formal than its adjacent sister park. It contains beautifully landscaped gardens, several memorials, and statues, but has notably fewer activities than Hyde Park (“Hyde Park & Kensington Gardens”).

It is possible at the British Museum! The first national public museum in the world allows individuals to explore its permanent collections for free. All that is required is an ahead-of-time booking for entry in one of the slots which are available in ten-minute intervals to avoid crowding. Once inside the museum, one is able to explore the extraordinary in-depth collections “unique in bringing together under one roof the cultures of the world, spanning continents and oceans” (“About us”). The museum also has several special exhibitions, which do require the purchase of a rather pricy ticket. Whether one explores these exhibitions or not, a visit to The British Museum is a remarkable experience. It is truly a museum like no others, not only because of its vast collection composed of over eight million pieces but due to the enlightenment ideals and values at its core. The museum thrives off of an “insatiable curiosity for the world”, conducts “sound research”, and contains “a desire to expand and share knowledge” (“About us”). Who wouldn’t want to take a short educational stroll through this remarkable free museum?</td>

It has over four hundred kilometers of tracks and about two hundred and seventy stations. It is one of the fastest, most reliable ways to get around in the busy city. Almost all famous landmarks have a stop station near or underneath them, so make sure you watch out for the iconic red and blue underground sign. As always, make sure you do your research ahead of time regarding what is most cost-efficient for you. The tube fares vary based on a variety of factors such as the time of day, distance traveled, and payment method. Contactless and the Oyster Card tend to be the cheapest options, but make sure you are familiar with their workings before you hop on the tube! (“London Underground”).
