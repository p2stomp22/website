		<td style="width:30%"><font color="1A5053" face="Century Gothic" size="4">The former Roman city then known as Londinium has been around since the first century. Over the many years of its existence, the capital of England has had numerous names--including  Lundenwic and Lundenburh--as well as many different settlers and rulers. Each left a mark on the city shaping it into the influential cosmopolitan city it is today. The metropolis has seen it all; times of extreme prosperity and times of utter catastrophe. The city has faced challenges from the plague to the deadly pollution following the industrial revolution. Its resilience enabled it to recover from the Great Fire destroying thousands of builidngs and the many militaries as well as terrorist attacks it has faced as it now thrives as one of the most influential financial centers in the world (“London”).</td>
