		<td style="width:30%"><font color="EEDECE" face="Century Gothic" size="4"> Starting out as “a small medieval settlement on dikes containing the Amstel where it met the IJ” (Wintle), Amsterdam has always had a remarkable connection with its surrounding waters. In the seventeenth century, also known as the Dutch Golden Age, the city’s strategic location along the Ijsselmeer and links to the North Sea allowed it to become the commerce capital in Europe. Trade was booming and colonization through the Dutch East Indian Company was rapid. Much of the city’s current architectural charm can be connected back to its past success. With hundreds of canals, the city is divided into approximately ninety small islands connected by over thirteen-hundred bridges. On each of these small islands are blocks of Amsterdam’s famous canal houses which previously served as warehouses and living quarters combined. Nowadays, most of the canal houses have been turned into apartments and the canals are primarily used for transport and drainage--given that the city is one-half of a meter below sea level (Wintle).</td>

Most shops are open every day from ten until seven. On Thursday, stores are commonly open until nine o’clock due to the Dutch tradition of   koopavond--late-night shopping (“Kalverstraat”).</td>

A former “working-class neighborhood” primarily occupied by immigrants, de Jordaan has been transformed into “one of the most expensive, upscale locations of the city” (“Jordaan”). The narrow cobblestone streets are filled with upscale boutiques, specialty shops, art galleries, and extraordinary restaurants making it a perfect area to visit and do a little shopping. One place to stop by when strolling through the neighborhood is de Negen Straatjes--the nine little streets-- the cozy streets located in the Canal Belt house a variety of unique little shops and cafes. (examples). Another spot in De Jordaan worth noting is the Noordermarkt next to the historical Noorderkerk--Northern Church. The Noordermarkt hosts a farmers’ market on Saturdays with organic produce, fresh meat, and authentic Dutch cheese, and on Mondays, the square is filled with art, antiques, trinkets, and vintage clothes for the weekly flea market (“Jordaan”).</td>

On a sunny day, one can find couples picnicking in the grass, children playing in the playground, tourists admiring the statues and sculptures, and elderly companions biking together. Vondel park is home to a rollerblade rental, a rose garden, numerous cafes and even an open-air theater occasionally used to host free concerts during the summertime. The park is open from dawn until dusk. Although it is completely safe during the day, it is best not to visit the park after sunset (“Vondelpark”).</td>

It was simply an office and warehouse; a place where Otto Frank ran the new Dutch branch of the German company selling a gelatin-like product called Opekta. In 1942, however, the ordinary Amsterdam canal house evolved into a hiding place housing two Jewish families, the Frank family and the van Pels family. Today, Prinsengracht 263 is a museum telling the story of its former one of the inhabitants: Anne Frank. Anne Frank was the youngest daughter of Otto and Edith Frank. She was passionate about writing and started to keep a diary when she turned thirteen, shortly before she was forced to hide in the annex of her father’s company. The diary of Anne Frank portrays her thoughts, feelings, and some of her own creative writing up until the summer of 1944, when the annex was discovered, and all of its inhabitants were deported to concentration camps. The Frank family initially spent time in Auschwitz, whereafter Anne and her older sister, Margot, were sent to Bergen-Belsen. Due to the horrific conditions inside the camp, they both contracted typhus and died just several weeks before the end of the war. The only person from the annex to survive the Holocaust was Otto Frank; he later published his daughter’s diary and was involved in the creation of the Anne Frank house (“Who was Anne Frank?”).</br></br>
		At the Anne Frank House, one is able to see the annex where Anne Frank once lived. The personal belongings of the other people who hid in the annex are also on display in addition to information about their lives. Visiting the museum is an impactful educational experience that draws many visitors. The entry fee is fourteen euros for adults, seven euros for youth aged seventeen to eleven, and four euros for children aged eleven and under. In addition to this, there is a one euro booking fee. Tickets are not sold at the door, so one should be sure to purchase them ahead of time (“Tickets”). </td>

Some of the artist's most famous masterpieces include Sunflowers, Almond Blossoms, The Bedroom, and Self-Portrait with Grey Felt Hat. At the van Gogh museum, one is able to explore each of these remarkable paintings and learn more about their creator (“The Permanent Collection: Van Gogh's Masterpieces”).</br></br>
		Van Gogh was born in 1853 In Zundert, the Netherlands. Over the course of his life, van Gogh lived in numerous places throughout Europe: The Netherlands, Belgium, England, and France. He took on many different occupations including art clerk, school teacher, and lay preacher until eventually, he became an artist at the age of twenty-seven. Van Gogh had many struggles in his life from the disapproval of his family, failing relationships, financial difficulty, and physical, as well as, mental illness. Van Gogh died by suicide at the age of thirty-seven. Although some of his work began to gain recognition, his fame did not pick up until several decades after his death.</br></br>
		Theo van Gogh--one of Vincent van Gogh’s younger brothers--gained ownership of the paintings after his beloved brother’s death. In memoriam, he attempted to create an art exhibition, but Theo van Gogh fell ill and died shortly after his brother’s death. His widow, Johanna van Gogh-Bonger, then decided to pursue the journey of fame for van Gogh. She lent out the paintings, set up exhibitions, and published the many letters the close brothers had exchanged throughout their life. After Johanna van Gogh-Bonger’s death, it was her son--also named Vincent--who loaned out the paintings to the state of the Netherlands, which eventually created the van Gogh Museum in 1973 (“Vincent's Life, 1853-1890”). Currently, over two million people explore and admire the work of Vincent van Gogh in the museum located in Amsterdam every year. It is one of the most beloved museums in the city. Tickets are only available online; admission is nineteen euros per adult and free admission for anyone under the age of eighteen. With the I Amsterdam Card, admission to this extraordinary museum is free (“Tickets and Ticket Prices”).</td>

		<td style="width:30%"><font color="EEDECE" face="Century Gothic" size="4">The Rijksmuseum is one of the oldest and most renowned museums in the Netherlands. In 1800, it first opened its doors as the National Art Gallery in The Hague. It was established   “as a ‘prestige project’ to inspire patriotic feeling”. When Napoleon Bonaparte took control of the Kingdom of Holland in 1808, the museum was moved into the Royal Palace in Amsterdam. Several years later, King Willem I named it the Rijks Museum and moved it once again. The museum stayed located in the Dutch capital although many of its pieces were relocated to various places in the Netherlands. In 1876, construction started on a new building designed by the famous architect Pierre Cuyper; it officially opened in 1885 and came to house the vast majority of old art collections in Amsterdam in addition to its previous collections. Since then, the museum has undergone many changes and renovations. The most recent renovation took place from 2003 to 2013, when the museum was restored to its original design by Cuypers. The museum currently portrays the history of the Netherlands through the centuries in chronological order and attracts several million visitors each year (“History”).</br></br>
		Some of the most famous pieces on display in the Rijksmuseum include The Nightwatch by Rembrandt van Rijn. This extraordinary artwork capturing one of Amsterdam’s early civic guard groups in action is difficult to miss as it is over eleven feet tall and fourteen feet wide (“The Night Watch, Rembrandt van Rijn, 1642”). The Milkmaid by Johannes Vermeer is another famous painting from the seventeenth century which portrays a simple everyday task--a maid peacefully pouring milk (“The Milkmaid, Johannes Vermeer, c. 1660”). The collections at the Rijksmuseum do not solely consist of paintings; there is a wide variety of artworks ranging from sculptures to jewelry and dollhouses to weaponry. The Rijksmuseum has a lot to offer; one can either explore the museum by themselves or book a guided or private tour. General admission is free for individuals ages eighteen and below, and nineteen euros for those older than nineteen. Booking ahead of time is recommended, this can be done on their website: Once again, with the I Amsterdam Card admission would be free (“Visit the Rijksmuseum”).</td>
